  abstract = {The paper presents our proposed solutions for the MediaEval 2020 Flood-Related Multimedia Task, which aims to analyze and detect flooding events in multimedia content shared over Twitter. In total, we proposed four different solutions including a multi-modal solution combining textual and visual information for the mandatory run, and three single modal image and text-based solutions as optional runs. In the multimodal method, we rely on a supervised multimodal bitransformer model that combines textual and visual features in an early fusion, achieving a micro F1-score of .859 on the development data set. For the text-based flood events detection, we use a transformer network (i.e., pretrained Italian BERT model) achieving an F1-score of .853. For image-based solutions, we employed multiple deep models, pre-trained on both, the ImageNet and places data sets, individually and combined in an early fusion achieving F1-scores of .816 and .805 on the development set, respectively.},

  abstract = {Early event detection and response can significantly reduce the societal impact of floods. Currently, early warning systems rely on gauges, radar data, models and informal local sources. However, the scope and reliability of these systems are limited. Recently, the use of social media for detecting disasters has shown promising results, especially for earthquakes. Here, we present a new database for detecting floods in real-time on a global scale using Twitter. The method was developed using 88 million tweets, from which we derived over 10,000 flood events (i.e., flooding occurring in a country or first order administrative subdivision) across 176 countries in 11 languages in just over four years. Using strict parameters, validation shows that approximately 90\% of the events were correctly detected. In countries where the first official language is included, our algorithm detected 63\% of events in NatCatSERVICE disaster database at admin 1 level. Moreover, a large number of flood events not included in NatCatSERVICE were detected. All results are publicly available on www.globalfloodmonitor.org.},

  abstract = {Timely and accurate information about ongoing events are crucial for relief organizations seeking to effectively respond to disasters. Recently, social media platforms, especially Twitter, have gained traction as a novel source of information on disaster events. Unfortunately, geographical information is rarely attached to tweets, which hinders the use of Twitter for geographical applications. As a solution, geoparsing algorithms extract and can locate geographical locations referenced in a tweet’s text. This paper describes TAGGS, a new algorithm that enhances location disambiguation by employing both metadata and the contextual spatial information of groups of tweets referencing the same location regarding a specific disaster type. Validation demonstrated that TAGGS approximately attains a recall of 0.82 and precision of 0.91. Without lowering precision, this roughly doubles the number of correctly found administrative subdivisions and cities, towns, and villages as compared to individual geoparsing. We applied TAGGS to 55.1 million flood-related tweets in 12 languages, collected over 3~years. We found 19.2 million tweets mentioning one or more flood locations, which can be towns (11.2 million), administrative subdivisions (5.1 million), or countries (4.6 million). In the future, TAGGS could form the basis for a global event detection system.},

  abstract = {In recent years, pluvial floods caused by extreme rainfall events have occurred frequently. Especially in urban areas, they lead to serious damages and endanger the citizens’ safety. Therefore, real-time information about such events is desirable. With the increasing popularity of social media platforms, such as Twitter or Instagram, information provided by voluntary users becomes a valuable source for emergency response. Many applications have been built for disaster detection and flood mapping using crowdsourcing. Most of the applications so far have merely used keyword filtering or classical language processing methods to identify disaster relevant documents based on user generated texts. As the reliability of social media information is often under criticism, the precision of information retrieval plays a significant role for further analyses. Thus, in this paper, high quality eyewitnesses of rainfall and flooding events are retrieved from social media by applying deep learning approaches on user generated texts and photos. Subsequently, events are detected through spatiotemporal clustering and visualized together with these high quality eyewitnesses in a web map application. Analyses and case studies are conducted during flooding events in Paris, London and Berlin.},

  abstract = {A vast amount of location information exists in unstructured texts, such as social media posts, news stories, scientific articles, web pages, travel blogs, and historical archives. Geoparsing refers to the process of recognizing location references from texts and identifying their geospatial representations. While geoparsing can benefit many domains, a summary of the specific applications is still missing. Further, there lacks a comprehensive review and comparison of existing approaches for location reference recognition, which is the first and a core step of geoparsing. To fill these research gaps, this review first summarizes seven typical application domains of geoparsing: geographic information retrieval, disaster management, disease surveillance, traffic management, spatial humanities, tourism management, and crime management. We then review existing approaches for location reference recognition by categorizing these approaches into four groups based on their underlying functional principle: rule-based, gazetteer matching-based, statistical learning-based, and hybrid approaches. Next, we thoroughly evaluate the correctness and computational efficiency of the 27 most widely used approaches for location reference recognition based on 26 public datasets with different types of texts (e.g., social media posts and news stories) containing 39,736 location references across the world. Results from this thorough evaluation can help inform future methodological developments for location reference recognition, and can help guide the selection of proper approaches based on application needs.},

This article evaluates five “best-of-class” location extraction algorithms. We develop a geoparsing algorithm using an OpenStreetMap database, and a geotagging algorithm using a language model constructed from social media tags and multiple gazetteers. Third-party work evaluated includes a DBpedia-based entity recognition and disambiguation approach, a named entity recognition and Geonames gazetteer approach, and a Google Geocoder API approach. We perform two quantitative benchmark evaluations, one geoparsing tweets and one geotagging Flickr posts, to compare all approaches. We also perform a qualitative evaluation recalling top N location mentions from tweets during major news events. The OpenStreetMap approach was best (F1 0.90+) for geoparsing English, and the language model approach was best (F1 0.66) for Turkish. The language model was best (F1@1km 0.49) for the geotagging evaluation. The map database was best (R@20 0.60+) in the qualitative evaluation. We report on strengths, weaknesses, and a detailed failure analysis for the approaches and suggest concrete areas for further research.},

These photos, associated with their geographic locations, can provide free, timely, and reliable visual information about flood events to the decision-makers. This screening system, designed for application to social media images, includes several key modules: tweet/image downloading, flooding photo detection, and a WebGIS application for human verification. In this study, a training dataset of 4800 flooding photos was built based on an iterative method using a convolutional neural network (CNN) developed and trained to detect flooding photos. The system was designed in a way that the CNN can be re-trained by a larger training dataset when more analyst-verified flooding photos are being added to the training set in an iterative manner. The total accuracy of flooding photo detection was 93\% in a balanced test set, and the precision ranges from 46–63\% in the highly imbalanced real-time tweets. The system is plug-in enabled, permitting flexible changes to the classification module. Therefore, the system architecture and key components may be utilized in other types of disaster events, such as wildfires, earthquakes for the damage/impact assessment.},

This real time nature of social media makes it an attractive tool for disaster management, as both victims and officials can put their problems and solutions at the same place in real time. We investigate the Twitter post in a flood related disaster and propose an algorithm to identify victims asking for help. The developed system takes tweets as inputs and categorizes them into high or low priority tweets. User location of high priority tweets with no location information is predicted based on historical locations of the users using the Markov model. The system is working well, with its classification accuracy of 81\%, and location prediction accuracy of 87\%. The present system can be extended for use in other natural disaster situations, such as earthquake, tsunami, etc., as well as man-made disasters such as riots, terrorist attacks etc. The present system is first of its kind, aimed at helping victims during disasters based on their tweets.},
