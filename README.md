### Description

The project focuses on extracting context related to flooding events from tweets
using Natural Language Processing, mainly in Sweden.

The file structure of the project is inspired by [khuyentran1401/data-science-template: Template for a data science project](https://github.com/khuyentran1401/data-science-template)

### Configuration

To be able to leverage twitter's API, use `.env.template` to create `.env`.
